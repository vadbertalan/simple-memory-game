# simple-memory-game
A simple game, where the user selects a few fields from a field zone which are needed to be remembered and reselected properly.

# Usage:
* Download the source files (they are not structured in packages to make the following steps easier for You :D).
* Fire up a shell (in windows file explorer [Ctrl+Shift+RightClick]) end enter "javac *.java" and "java Frame".
* Enjoy! 

# PS
I know it's no biggie, it was just a short exercise for me for my upcoming Java laboratory exam at the university. :)
